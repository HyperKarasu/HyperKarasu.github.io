            <b>Crown Shynes</b><i> (also canopy disengagement<sup>[1]</sup>,
             canopy shyness<sup>[2]</sup>, or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>)
             is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns 
             of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
             channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees
              of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.
              [6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an 
              adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
              leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]
