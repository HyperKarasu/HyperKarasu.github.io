    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or 4 chicken breast cutlets)</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>8 ounces cremini or button mushrooms, cleaned and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2/3 cup dry Marsala wine</li>
            <li>2/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth or water</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley, optional, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Slice each breast in half<br>
                horizontally, forming 4 chicken breast cutlets.<br>
                <sub>(Skip this part if using cutlets.)<br>
                    Place between two large pieces of parchment paper and pound<br> 
                    lightly to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin.<br>
                    Remove the top sheet of parchment and transfer the chicken<br>
                    on the bottom piece of parchment to a large baking sheet.
                </sub>
            </li>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place 1/4 cup flour in<br>
                a shallow bowl. Scatter and dust both sides of each chicken<br>
                cutlet with flour. Shake off any excess and transfer to a new<br>
                piece of parchment. Roll up the flour-covered parchment and<br>
                throw it away.
            </li>
            <li>Set a large, preferably 12-inch cast-iron skillet or similar pan<br>
                over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons oil and 1<br>
                tablespoon butter.<br>
                Once the butter has melted, add the chicken cutlets to the pan<br>
                in a single layer. Cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes,<br>
                then flip and cook 4 more minutes. Transfer to a serving plate<br>
                and cover with foil.
            </li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the mushrooms to the<br>
                pan and cook, stirring occasionally until golden brown, about 4<br>
                minutes. Add the garlic and the remaining 1 tablespoon of<br>
                flour and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.<br>
                <br>
                Add the Marsala and simmer until reduced by half, about 1<br>
                minute, scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Add the<br>
                broth and thyme and cook until slightly thickened, 3 to 4<br>
                minutes. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter and swirl to<br>
                melt and combine. Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken back to the pan and spoon the sauce over, or<br>
                pour the sauce over the chicken on its platter. Garnish with<br>
                parsley, if using, and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
