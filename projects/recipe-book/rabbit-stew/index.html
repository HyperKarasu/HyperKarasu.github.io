    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 heads garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds mixed mushrooms</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 rabbit</li>
            <li>3 large shallots<br><sub>chopped</sub></li>
            <li>1 cup sherry or white wine</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups mushroom soaking water</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons dried</li>
            <li>1 large parsnip, peeled and chopped into large pieces</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F</li>
            <li>Slice the top third off the heads of garlic and drizzle the olive<br>
                oil over them. Wrap the heads loosely in foil and bake for 45<br>
                minutes to an hour, or until cloves are soft and brown.<br>
                Set aside to cool.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, soak the dried porcini mushrooms in 2 cups hot<br>
                water.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the rabbit into serving pieces and salt well. Let sit at room<br>
                temperature for 30 minutes as the garlic finishes roasting. Use<br>
                all of the rabbit in this dish<br>
                <sub>you can fish out the ribs and other parts that have little or<br>
                    no meat on them later; they will add vital flavor to your stew
                </sub>
            </li>
            <li>If you are going to make the crème fraiche-liver thickener<br>
                mince the rabbit liver finely and move it to a small bowl.<br>
                Vigorously mix in about 1 1/2 tablespoons crème fraiche or<br>
                sour cream. Now put the mixture into a fine-meshed sieve over<br>
                a bowl and push it through with a rubber spatula. Reserve in<br>
                the fridge.
            </li>
            <li>Chop off the tough ends of the mushroom stems and either<br>
                discard or save for stock. Roughly chop or slice the<br>
                mushrooms and set aside. Dice the rehydrated porcini. Pour<br>
                the porcini soaking water through a paper towel into another<br>
                bowl. Reserve the liquid.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a thick-bottomed large pot on high heat for 1 minute. Add<br>
                the mushrooms and shake the pot. Stirring continuously, dry<br>
                sauté the mushrooms until they release their water.<br>
                Turn the heat down to medium-high. Use a wooden spoon to<br>
                scrape up any mushroom bits off the bottom of the pan. Salt<br>
                the mushrooms lightly. When the mushroom liquid is mostly<br>
                gone, remove them to a bowl.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Add the butter to the pot. When the butter melts, turn the heat<br>
                down to medium. Pat the rabbit pieces dry and place in the pan.<br>
                Work in batches if you need to, do not crowd the pan. Brown<br>
                the pieces well on all sides. Remove the rabbit pieces from the<br>
                pot and set aside.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and add the shallots to the<br>
                pot. Sauté until the shallots are nicely wilted, about 3 minutes.<br>
                Stir from time to time. Sprinkle salt over everything.
            </li>
            <li>While the shallots are cooking, squeeze the roasted garlic into<br>
                the mushroom soaking water you have strained, then whisk it<br>
                together.
            </li>
            <li>Add the sherry or white wine to the shallots in the pot. Use a<br>
                wooden spoon to scrape off any browned bits on the bottom<br>
                of the pot. Let the sherry boil down by half. Add the<br>
                mushroom-roasted garlic mixture and the stock and stir to<br>
                combine.
            </li>
            <li>Add the thyme, all the mushrooms, the rabbit, and the parsnips<br>
                and bring everything to a bare simmer.<br>
                Simmer gently for 90 minutes. You want the meat to be close<br>
                to falling off the bone. If you want, you can fish out all the<br>
                rabbit pieces and pull the meat off the bone<br>
                <sub>it makes the dish less attractive, but it will be easier to<br>
                    eat.Taste for salt right before you serve and add if<br>
                    needed.Stir in the parsley.
                </sub>
            </li>
            <li>If you are using the crème fraiche-liver mixture to thicken your<br>
                stew, turn off the heat. When the stew stops bubbling, add the<br>
                mixture and let it heat through for a minute before serving.<br>
                Do not allow the stew to boil once the liver-crème fraiche<br>
                mixture is in it or it will curdle.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Serve with a crusty loaf of bread, a green salad, and either a<br>
                hearty white wine, a dry rose, or a light red wine.
            </li>
